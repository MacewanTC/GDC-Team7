The players are a group of archeologists who have landed on monkey island (tropical) where the currency is coconuts. There is a hidden coconut treasure on the island which players are searching for which ends the game and rewards the finder with coconuts. The win condition is having the most coconuts when the treasure is found. 

Race based board game with a twist as the win condition is not the end game condition. 2 - 4 players. Each player rolls a d6 and moves onto on of 40 spaces on the board each allowing the player who lands on them to pick up the coconuts stored there and a card of the spaces type. 

Fast paced game with high player on player interference. A very child-like aesthetic but with adult mechanics kind of like happy tree friends.

Card Types:
	Currency
	Trap
	Bad luck
	Event
